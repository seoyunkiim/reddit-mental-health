Anxiety,"No idea how to deal with new anxiety For as long as I can remember, I have never been an anxious person or anything, in fact I used to roll my eyes at people who would use mental health/anxiety as an excuse because I just couldn’t comprehend why they didn’t move on from it. 

Then, right before Christmas, I hit the bong with my roommates (normal night) and I had a full blown panic attack that lasted for hours. It fucked me up for a couple of days, I cried, etc and then I kinda went back to normal... and then two months later I decided to hit the bong again. My logic was “fuck it, weed is supposed to relax you/it used to make me feel so good!” Another panic attack happened, of course. 

Ever since the second one I’ve been having chest pains, and even after two doctors trips, one to urgent care, one to my PCP, where they confirmed there wasn’t anything wrong, I still have been struggling. First it was simply while going to bed but now I constantly am getting twinges and stuff and I keep imagining the symptoms of a heart attack. I have hypertension too, despite only being 19 and being physically active most of the year from sports, which makes me go even crazier. 

I think that somehow THC or whatever changed/activated some hormone or chemical for anxiety. It’s to the point now where I start worrying if I DONT feel uncomfortable or have twinges. I just don’t know what to do, especially in light of COVID where I can’t see or really want to go see a doctor. Right now, I’m so tired but I can’t sleep because I’ve convinced myself that I’m going to die in my sleep. I can’t focus on anything and I’m doing the bare minimum to maintain my social/school life at the moment. 

I guess what I was wondering was if 1.) anyone else can relate to this kind of experience and 2.) how can I start dealing with this. I have a journal that I write in but it only does so much. I appreciate any response, and thank you for reading all of this :)"
Anxiety,does anyone else get the following symptoms: sometimes i’ll just be doing something and it’ll feel kinda like my heart skips a beat and then i’m like woah like what’s going on like my vision might get blurry for a sec and everything just feels off and then i’m fine. it’s weird and so hard to explain. often accompanied by weird feeling in my throat or my body thinking i’m not getting enough oxygen
Anxiety,"I DID IT, I COULD GO TO SCHOOL WITHOUT FEELING BAD, WITHOUT ANY PANIC ATTACK do not give up friends, find peace, try to find the root of your anxieties. I promise you that you will find the solution, I love you"
Anxiety,"Death Anxiety Rant. It is Currently 2:25. 
I’m sitting on my bathroom floor listening to Fade to black by Metallica. 
Having a very bad Anxious episode. 
7 hours ago, wave of anxiety hit me. 
I didn’t know where it was coming from 
Why it was here or why i deserved it. 
It just, Hit me. 
Now i’m sitting here in my bathroom thinking i’m gonna die, Or that death is coming soon. 
I’ve been feeling this way for months but sometimes at night, I’m almost sure i will die. 
I just feel like my time has come, Although i’m not ready for my time to be up. 
But that’s life. 
And that’s death.
Your never ready, Sometimes we wish we could live as immortals. Sometimes we wish to Leave earlier. 
I know that one day we all must go, And that’s just the hard pill i can never seem to swallow. 
These thoughts of Sudden Death keep me awake at night. 
I don’t wanna die, But if i do. 
I of course wanna be in heaven. 
I wanna be up there with everyone from the past, i’ll Finally be able to meet Chris Cornell, Layne Staley, Eddie Van Halen, Joey Jordison and even some past pets and People of my own. 
But that’s if i get into heaven. 
Because who knows where you go after you die. 
Reincarnation? Hell for eternity? Heaven And live Life? Who knows. 
That’s the scary part. 
What the hell is the after life about? 
Yet i’d keep wondering What it’s about than Live in the after life. 
It seems so scary. 
But i know it can be so beautiful. 
But i cannot live without most things on earth, For how would i live In the afterlife? 
I’d rather become a reincarnation, Live anther life and forgive and forget about this one. 
But i’m not saying i want to at this moment. 
But remember how i said life isn’t fair? 
And neither is death? 
That’s the most scary part. 
Sudden, Surprising, Shocking, Tragic Death. 
No warning sometimes. 
That’s the part that’s really hell. 
So, I’m here so ask, Does anyone else have death anxiety? Or is it just the girl that sits on bathroom floor at 2:35 on a Wednesday afternoon? 
Anyone? Anyone at all?…"
Anxiety,"We were practicing Alright everyone, all of our anxiety and panic was just us practicing for a real-life survival situation. Now that we know we can handle it (and I know you can because you're reading this) let's stop practicing and get back to living. We know we can make it and we know we have more practice in a hectic situation than ""normal people,"" so let's put it aside until we really need it. Let your amygdala scare you a bit and tell it that you aren't in danger. Thank it for preparing you for danger and then tell it that you will call upon it when it is needed. Just know that we have been in situations where our amygdala has saved our lives at least once whether it was avoiding a car wreck or jumping out of the way of a snake so we wouldn't be here without it. It is our clingy friend, just firmly but politely let it know that we need some space of our own when you feel it approaching. You all are great and you've all made it this far. Keep on going, you absolute legends."
Anxiety,"I could really use some advice for handling anxiety in a relationship. So a lil back story on us, my last relationship was beginning of my senior year so I was 17 and ended right before I turned 18, I’m 22 now. She is 21 and 6 or 7 months ago just got out of an almost 3 year long relationship and was in a relatively long one before that I just can’t remember the exact number. So obviously, she is a lot more mature than I am when it comes to relationships. I don’t mind this, it’s actually really good for me I think because seeing her perspective on different things shows me other pov’s. 

But I struggle with overthinking a lot and she knows about and does put in effort to help give me reassurance if she’s gonna be busy and she won’t be able to talk for awhile. But lately our texts have been few and far between and we haven’t FaceTimed that much. We live 2 and a half hours away so that’s where we talk the most. It’s mostly because she just got a new job and finals are coming but I still can’t help but to feel like I’m doing something that’s pushing her away. 

She’s said before that she isn’t very good at texting which is understandable, so am I but what really gets me anxious is if I text her and she posts stuff on social media, or dm’s me somethin but then doesn’t respond back to me on text. Or today she’s responded on insta dm a couple times and still hasn’t texted me back. 

I just don’t know how to deal with this kinda stuff, so if anyone has any advice please tell me. I really like her and I know she likes me too but over analyzing every little thing is gonna drive me insane and I really don’t wanna mess this up because I’m being too needy."
Anxiety,"teens to be friends with is there by any chance there are some teens that have anxiety that i can be friends with and talk to on here? everyone is so nice and it would be nice to have some people to talk to my age and that know what i’m going through, feel free to me message me your snap or if you want to chat on here that is fine!"
Anxiety,"I feel that I can't live like this anymore Just before a month ago, I was happy and I never knew I was. I was really fucking happy. Turns out, that I decided to eat an edible for the first time. I did not know it would change my fucking life. The edible triggered a panic attack attack along with some other crazy stuff. While I was on the effects of the edible, I started to move my hands on a crazy way like I couldn't control it. Then I also started to think that I might stay like that forever and that I would lose my intelligence while being hospitalized forever (for being crazy). After the higher effects of the weed ran out, I then started to come back to my normal self and my girlfriend calmed me down while we were in a call. A few days later, I then wake up to a car passing by because I heard the noise of the car as if it was a person screaming so that triggered another panic attack since I started to think that I might have the onset of schizophrenia. Since then, since I started to think that I might have the onset of schizophrenia,  and every sound that I hear I relate that to the effects of schizophrenia.  Everytime I hear a sound during an anxiety attack at night I start to think that ""my mind is producing those sounds, you might have schizophrenia. You will live like that forever, it would get worse, you will live in fear for the rest of your life, etc.)."" Every since.. every since I tried that fucking edible, it changed my life. 

Turns out that I contacted a therapist via the app of betterhelp because it is cheap. I had two therapists, and both of them said that I do not appear to have the onset schizophrenia. My current therapist, diagnosed me with anxiety and panics along with something else that may be bothering me. She introduced me to mindfulness and meditation, and ever since then I started to have less anxiety attacks. However, I decided to smoke weed since I knew that edibles are stronger than smoking weed, and so because of that it may be okay. I smoked one time and everything was chill and cool + it relieved a pain that I was having. Then one week later I smoked again and UFFFFFF. I was with my cousin, when I smoked it I started to hear voices (which I had no fucking clue if it was from actual reality) and it was just a really really really mentally painful experience. Every since that day, I started to have much worse anxiety attacks and everything is just worse. I need help, I'm not sure if I should spend the little money I have (which I'm saving for a car) to go to a Psychiatrist so he/she can recommend me some treatment or something because I cant continue to live like this. 

I used to be happy and I didn't know it, everytime I start to get anxiety I blame myself for trying that edible... I WAS REALLY FUCKING HAPPY... I feel like I would never be happy again, like as if this would stay forever and I would actually get schizophrenia (if I don't have it already). I. CAN'T. CONTINUE. TO. LIVE. LIKE. THIS."
Anxiety,"Spiralling? TW: health issues/cancer

I’m a senior in high school, taking some classes online so I can instead spend more time with &amp; taking care of my dad who’s been seriously ill for as long as I can remember with various chronic &amp; genetic diseases. It’s really been taking a toll on me these past few months especially combined with the stress of school and moving out soon to go to college. 

Last week, he had a major cancer scare and I wasn’t told about it until late on in the whole process. I went out to the groceries as a half assed excuse to get out of the house and clear my mind and had a terrible panic attack for the first time in about a year. I also had an episode of dissociation like I’ve never had before, I wasn’t sure what was happening until I collapsed while shopping. It was so scary and I’ve never experienced anything like it.

Since then, I haven’t felt the same. I haven’t felt nearly as motivated to do things as I usually do and am falling behind on my school work and having a hard time doing things I need to do to take care of my dad let alone myself. The sort of constant, physically painful anxiety I’ve been feeling is something I haven’t felt in years. I’ve been on SSRIs for about 4 years and stopped CBT probably 6 months ago after being really successful with it for 2 years and feeling ready to stop. I’m honestly not sure what to do. I know how to cope with anxiety usually but I’m just so physically and mentally tired and have no motivation to actually take the steps to cope. Resting has been making me anxious feeling like I need to be working or doing something but having to energy to do it like a feedback loop. 

Any advice would be really appreciated. I’ve been feeling so alone these past few days and honestly anything would be nice. If you made it to the end here, thanks. Hope you’re doing alright"
Anxiety,"Wow. So let’s talk about Prozac. I take a generic of Prozac and today for the first time I took it without eating. 
Dude. The heartburn was REAL. It was intense AF. I thought my chest was going to explode plus my throat was on fire. This lasted for about an hour of intense heartburn. I took 4 tums and when those didn’t work drank some baking soda and water.
2 hours later, and after a nap, I woke up with my chest still not feeling good but better, and then basically had water sh*ts for the next hour on and off. Have not eaten today pretty much bc I don’t want to try to stomach anything and have it not settle.
It is 8 hours later and I still feel like there is a lump in my throat and my chest is still sore. 

Jesus. Never again."
Anxiety,"Chest pain? Since yesterday night i have been feeling a little pain slightly to the left of my chest, and it's driving me nuts! I thought it could be due to starting a new workout routine at the gym, but i can't shake the fear that i'm going to have a heart attack or something.

There shouldn't be nothing wrong with my heart. Ove the last 6 months i have done many blood and heart exams (thanks to other amxiety simptoms), and as far as i know everything is fine. But i can't stop thinking ""well, those were months ago, what if now is something serious?""

I barelly slept tonight because i was terrified that if i lost conciouness i would never wake up again. Amd now besides the chest pain i also feel like i was hit by a truck!

Anyone else have this? :("

And there’s no one I can tell, so I’m just leaving this here. I hate being crazy so, so much. And yes, I’m medicated. But still. Still."
Anxiety,"Cats are good people Last night my phone freaked out. It shut itself off and it would not reboot. I could get it to the loading screen, but that was it. Sat up until almost 3 AM trying to figure out how to get it to work. Finally had to give up for the night and attempt to sleep. This morning, I was right back to fighting with it. I tried everything I could think of or find via the Google for a Motorola phone that wouldn't boot up, and it was not working. I was getting kinda panicky- loosing the progress on my games would suck, but I was terrified I was going to have to do a factory reset and I'd loose all my pictures and videos of my little nephew being adorable.  

This where the cat comes in. My giant ginger fluffball of a cat isn't usually very social in the morning. He demands his kitty cookies, then off he goes to patrol the house. Today, while I was sitting in the middle of my bed freaking out over my damn phone, he comes waddling into the room. Hops up on the bed with me. And spends the next half hour purring at me and kneading the blankets and demanding pets and scritches. Coincidentally, that's also about the time I tried plugging my phone into my laptop, and pop! On it went. So thank you, fuzzy-bear, for saving me from myself."

Anxiety,"My battle with emetophobia and what I learned in therapy Emetophobia is the fear of vomiting, generally speaking and I'm currently in the middle of therapy. I want to tell you my story so far. 

I was diagnosed earlier this year with Specific Anxiety Disorder with the fear of vomiting. But it's not only that. For me, it's also the fear of getting sick with stomach flu and everything connected with it. (though it doesn't have to be like that for everyone!) 
It is impacting my life in many different ways.



**Beginning / the incident**

It all started on Christmas 2017 where me and my (now Ex) boyfriend drove over to my mom's place and had Christmas dinner. The next day she got sick with the noro virus and had to go to the doctor. My and my ex couldn't leave until the next day and we already felt exhausted in the morning right after waking up. We had to drive 7h home and my ex was the one driving. We could barely manage to keep ourselves awake and one time he stopped because he almost fell asleep while driving. We barely made it home. And I really couldn't keep myself awake and slept during the whole ride. 
We went to sleep right away but in the morning the hell night started. ( could be gross so you can skip the next paragraph) 

We both woke up and he had to vomit almost 6 times within a few hours. I didn't have to vomit but I had a lot of diarrhea. And whenever he jumped out of the bed to rush to the toilet, I went dissociative because I couldn't handle the sounds of him vomiting. 
They wouldn't leave my mind until a few weeks later.  I did my best to care for him too since I felt a bit better than him. After one week we felt better, even though we still had to feed ourselves with soup as we couldn't handle solid food yet. 


I felt so bad for falling asleep in the car even though he asked me to talk to him so he can keep himself awake. I felt like I was failing him. 
It was really traumatizing, but I was in therapy too back then and talked about it with my therapist. I thought I processed it well. I was wrong. 
Few months after, in April, I had my first panic attack. I was eating in a restaurant when I had to burp but it didn't come out. My brain thought that I had to vomit. I got sweaty and anxious but I managed to keep silent. I just asked my ex that we go home. We paid and when we were at home, I napped for the rest of the day because it was so exhausting. 



**The peak of my anxiety**

Over the year of 2018, I would have panic attacks every few weeks. I didn't think that I had to do something about it back then. 
But as the winter months and especially Christmas came closer, they became more and more frequent. 
It was November /December when I was at my worst. I just broke up with my ex(due to other reasons) and moved to my new partner. I had a massive amount of stress that probably even amplified my symptoms. 

For example I wouldn't dare to touch the bars in public transportation out of fear of getting infected. Or I wouldn't eat food that isn't ""safe"" (like, won't give me digestion problems). I lost a lot of weight due to not eating enough. 
Getting digestion problems would also drive my anxiety over the roof because my brain thinks that I'm getting sick.
If I for any reason think that I can get sick, I would be unstable for a few days until I see that I didn't get sick. I didn't dare to fall asleep out of fear of waking up and being sick. I didn't dare to nap out of fear that this was the pre sickness exhaustion that I had during the car ride. 
If I fell asleep, I would have panic attacks in the morning and I'd spent an hour in the bathroom, waiting for the worst but It never happened. It never happened when I had panic attacks. 

Getting through the winter months was living hell. I had panic attacks almost every day and it felt like living next to a burning house and having to constantly watch out that the fire doesn't take over my own house.  It drained all my energy that I had. I went out with friends less, could barely go to work or even be productive there, I was a mess. I eventually lost that job earlier this year. (because of other reasons, but the productivity was one of the reasons)

When I could actually relax one day because my partner took care of me, I broke out in tears and decided to go into therapy. I was lucky and didn't have to wait long for an appointment.
The worst part was when I re visited my mom this year in January. I basically relived the trauma.. Or at least my brain constantly feared the trauma. But it didn't happen. But it showed me again how bad it actually was. 

The stress over all the months eventually actually caused heavy digestion issues which even fed my anxiety. But I somehow survived it. And I had to confront my fears and teach my brain that the feared outcome doesn't have to happen.
I didn't do much in therapy yet. I rather made a huge progress myself since January because I had to overcome my digestion issues.


**The diagnosis**

My therapist gave me a huge pile of questionnaires that covered all possible mental illnesses. They were tedious to fill out, but I understand that my therapist doesn't want to miss anything so we can address it in therapy. 
It took 4 sessions to complete all of the diagnostic stuff. Then the real therapy began. 


**what I learned and what helps me battling my worries**

I've built my toolbox.
Due to the involuntary confrontation with digestion issues, I had to relearn my body signals. Not every noise that my belly makes means that I'm getting diarrhea or even sick.
Sometimes it means that I'm hungry, or that I just have to fart. I had to learn to distinguish nausea from having to burp. Generally I had to learn that what I was experiencing wasn't in fact nausea.

I learned that If I reach out to anyone (mostly my partner) and tell them what my brain feared (no matter how ridiculous it sounds) that we could debunk every aspect of it by rationally stating the facts. Often, it would prevent me from even entering the spiral of anxiety.

Most of the stuff I've taught myself outside of therapy. (I have to say that I had some tools left from an earlier therapy and my partner had some pretty helpful tools.) Now... I don't have to live in constant fear anymore. I can eat normally again (mostly) and I can even go to restaurants again (when I before couldn't). I made some huge progress so far. 



**What I'll have to do in the future**

I am still nowhere near the end of therapy though . I still have to acquire a lot of tools so that I don't have to go through hell again once the winter months come back.
Now the real hard part therapy begins. I will have to confront myself to vomiting. Step for step. First, thinking about it, second, seeing vomit etc. 
I will never have to do a step if I'm not ready or if I don't want to. (like actually make myself vomit) 
That is actually a common misconception about confrontational therapy. It is always in your pace. It's a controlled exposure to the things you fear. It's hard, but effective. 




**Some comments about my journey**

I am proud of myself for making it this far. I deserve to be and it doesn't make me a bad person. It's a personal victory that I deserve to celebrate it.
But the same goes to you! If you have been going through a rough time and still made it to this point, it's worth celebrating, no matter how much progress you made.
I know how hard it is to go through hell. And hell is subjective to everyone. Your struggle is valid. Don't be afraid to reach out.  Open and honest communication with my partner, parents and my therapist helped me so much. Without their support I couldn't have made it this far. Especially my partner. We as a couple grew even closer together when we took the battle together. It's worth it. Believe me.  Reach out and use the resources you have.
And most of all, thank you for reading all of this. I hope that I could reach anyone out there with similar struggles as me and tell them that they're not alone.
If you have any questions about my emetophobia or anything else, feel free to ask me. I'm happy to share.

Anxiety,"I just can't keep a job... I'm sure that this post will lead to a lot of judgement but honestly I don't care. I just need to get this off my chest.

I have been anxious since late childhood/my teenage years.

Now I'm in my mid 20s and I never had a stable job. Honestly, I don't know if this is because of my anxiety and depressive episodes/OCD and the eating disorder that I'm struggling with.

I have a good (formal) education and I have always been very succesful at school and at university. Maybe one of the best in the class/group. My teachers and my parents thought that I will have a bright future ahead of me but here I am... Fatigued, tired of my life, not being able to hold down even the simplest job (if there is any). I have tried a lot but I just seem to get overwhelmed and I don't show up or I quit via phone call. I just can't stand the thought of going to work so I don't show up and I get so frustrated...

I have tried working from home but it just made me more miserable. I crave human contact but I can't seem to make myself act like every other human being. I feel so tired from this way of living. I sound like a lazy piece of s\*it, I know. Maybe I am.

Every advice would be appreciated."
Anxiety,"After 3 years fearing it ....... I think im in the prodromal stage of schizophrenia and here is why *Trigger warning

Hi I'm 25 male
All my life i've been obssessed about existince itself and about concussions
I remember even when i was 10 years old asking my mom about everything in life 
Then at the age of 14 due to my fears of those thoughts i developed ocd like symptoms 
And at age of 15 my friend told me that he can read minds which made me alot paranoid of him which lasts for nearly 2 weeks 
.........
After that nothing really big  happened (some solplism ocd and some existenial ocd) 
Until i was 22 when my dad died ... I couldn't resist the anxiety and the panic that happened i couldn't even think about any think but im going crazy 
I started to obsess about it as hell ... No good days 24/7 just obsessing if im crazy or not 
I started to compulsively observing my every thought every word i say every thing i do if its ""crazy"" or people might think its crazy or not 
After maybe 4 months of that really bad time i started medecine which did it work well after it gave me 2 weeks of constant panic 
After that i started to read and here it comes the horrible part : 
I read litterelly about every single mental illness 
And i could obsess about every symptoms i read 
I was afraid of bipolar ... Dps ... Every mental illness 
......
Until i came to some guys who described the prodromal stage of schizophrenia 
A german scientist called conrad describing what really was going with me ( as being always scared that something might happened at any moment) which he described as (delusional mood) which made me scared As hell
To the point i was convinced that im prodromal schizophrenic
I discused that with my doctor which she refused and said that there is nothing called as prodromal phase 
So i went to another doctor who said that he is 100 percent sure that all im suffering is ocd and im not gonna be psychotic whole my life 
That comfort me a little and he put me on  a salad of medicine 
I took them for nearly 6 months  then everything was better 
But i would have some symptoms that scares the hell out of me :
The most important ones : 
1- Hypnagogic hallucinations which i know they are normal but they were preventing me to sleep
2- voices pop in my mind when im anxious or in bed that would be memory of something i heard at the day or maybe some random phrases that make no sense 
3 - when im walking i would misidentifiy people for a glance ( a second or less) i would see a strange person and im like this is x (some one i know) but after a while a get scared and asking my self (am i really delusional or i just feel that the person looks like x)

4 - some really anomalous self-expirience 
Like sometimes when looking at a mirror i would have a weird feeling which make me panicked for a while
5- when thinking about existince i would literally get panicked and feeling to hit my head on the wall to shake the ideas
6- the solplism ocd made the way through all of this to make me question whether i believe that I'm only the existnce being which would put a barrier between me and others and scared the hell out of me(what if im convinced and being delusional) 
7- illusions ... Alot of them 
8- memory problems
............................
So i was off medicine but last two weeks everything was horrible I couldn't eat sleep or focus or do anything but obssessing and reading ( i read more than 1000 or 2000 scientist articals about schizophren prodrom) and how it is developed : 
And here what convinced me : 
Two scientist are specialized about schizophrena described this illness as a distrubtued of self 
And the mentioned about 57 anomalous self experiences that schizophrena patients described in their prodromal phase 
Which i could really relate to maybe 10 of the experiences 
..........
Second those two scientist described a compulsive mind-observation and the told some examples 
Which i think i can relate 
....
-One patient said that he couldnt hear to radio because she was thinking about the radio waves and its frequency comes to her head 
-And another was obssessing about thinking itself because if he wasn't thinking there he doesn't exist 
- and the last one describes that a simple act such as drinking water madehim think about every little detail to do it like going to kitchen oppening tap have the glass and full it then closing the tap 
.....
The three examples made the patient really anxious and exahusted and have oc symptoms 
And that what it think what is happening to me 
.....
Because litterelly when im walking i would look at a car and say its a car 
Or look at some one and says i know i dont think that man is someone i know but i think he looks like it 
And i know that Hypnagogic hallucinations and illusions are normal but still i got really frightened by them
And after reading about how schizophrinc would take much longer to understand the phrases because they analyse every single world i feel im doing this too
....
 I took ssri and antipsychotic (so low dose) for ocd
That was for maybe a year and half and I didn't recover which fuel the fear more of being at prodromal stage 
......
So the question for everyone with pure o schiz-ocd
Can you relate ? 
Do you ever hear about the ultra high risk people to psychosis and the tools that describe it like (Ease .. Caarms ..blibs... Sips ....sops) 
Or can you relate to the compulsive  mind-observation
.....
Please i need help 
Im in panic state even with my medicine and what should i do if the doctors in my country dont know about prodromal schizophrena alot 
And if this ever happens to you to question everything justs to check if you are being schizophrenic or not"
Anxiety,"Wanting to date but anxiety stops me I’m 23 woman and have only been on a few dates. I really want to start dating. I get asked out here and there but I get so anxious I usually  say no. Or I overthink everything and stop talking to them/making excuses about why I should not date them.

BPD,"My wife put a restraining order on me I have bpd,severe depression, severe anxiety,  and PTSD. I also suffer from extreme night terrors.  I take a lot of meds to help me get through life.  When I take my night time meds they knock me out for a long time.  I woke up today with a sheriff's card taped to my door. I tried calling my wife but it went to vm. I call the sheriff and he brought the paperwork to me. I cant see my wife and son for 90 days. I dont even know what I did. It says on the paperwork that I hurt her but I have no memory of it. I really dont know what to do.  I got a DUI in March and I have to go back to court in a couple weeks but I have no way of getting there. They'll issue a warrant for my arrest and I'll spend sometime locked up. I hate myself and my life. I think this is it for me. I just want this to be a twisted joke or nightmare. 

*edit*
Turns out I didnt hurt her. A friend came over because my wife asked her to check on me. She did this to me because she thinks itll force me to get my shit together. I understand that and can forgive it, what I cant forgive is the fact that she took my son away from me. No warning, just up and left."
BPD,"Do I actually have the symptom of having a ‘favourite person’? To clarify bpd, is literally the one thing that’s made sense in my life. The one explanation. So please just be weary of however you respond. I’ve had endless suicide attempts, have punched a wall till I bled, self harm a good bunch of times now (my wrist has scars all over it at this point) have pushed people away that may have loved me and in all honesty, I don’t even regret that. They abused me like crazy.

However the one symptom that I’m not sure I have, is a favourite person. The way that a person feels about an fp, I’ll often get that same feeling with friends. Trust me, there have been friends that have rejected, that resulted to me self harming, attempting suicide and much more. But this would happen as each friend goes by. I’d get a friend, would be overwhelmed that they’re even choosing to be friends with the likes of me, and for the duration of that friendship they would be my fp. Once it ends, my whole world would indeed crumble around me, and honestly it would stay that way, until I can find another friend to take that friends place. But like I say, this is the cycle. So the question remains, do I actually have an fp, or can a person have various fp’s, as they go through their life?"
BPD,"Anyone ever been diagnosed with Bipolar AFTER BPD as a Dual Diagnosis? So I got a print out of my diagnoses by accident basically the other day and after opening up to my psychiatrist about a recent period of my life that has been pure hell and I started new meds, I see “Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Complex PTSD, Bipolar Mood Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder”. 

Guys I feel absolutely fucking certifiable. And I say this while completely laughing and crying nearly at the same time. I had a print out in the past that didn’t have Bipolar on it. For some added history I have made a lifetime of progress with my BPD. I am a quiet type but 6 years ago I was super severe. It was like a quiet volcano of self destruction and agony that I know only this sub understands. I impulse attempted so many times. I hated myself and I hated BPD. I never thought I’d be able to breathe. In the past year and a half after 5 and a half years of aggressive DBT it was the best it’s ever been. I felt the weight of BPD lifting in a way where it didn’t completely define me or run my life. I felt a sense of control. 


But now homegirls Bipolar lmfao. I do not doubt this diagnosis for a second. I’ve gone through a lot these past 6 months that I had frankly never felt before? I think I did once a long time ago but in the background of my tumultuous BPD but definitely BPD overshadowed. And I recently with these new feelings/episodes and struggles thought of Bipolar for a second but I thought wtf there is no way. There can’t be. On top of Bpd? Nah. Not possible. It’s just BPD (while totally not feeling like BPD) or the fact that I’m going through a lot. But after this paper I thought “ idk about you but I don’t always go through a lot but when I do I don’t always alternate between severe periods of depression and hypomania” and I thought yeah yeah ok maybe these circumstances just triggered it cause when I put it like that ok I get it. At least my moods been consistent? Lol. Consistently inconsistent. Anyways, I read more about Bipolar and bipolar as a dual diagnosis and all of it’s struggles and I feel a bit upset that I didn’t realize before that I had a dual diagnosis because wow it would’ve helped me so much but whatever. In a way I am also completely in denial. And also why didn’t my psychiatrist talk to me? Makes me feel a little more crazy and it all less real. Like is he sure? Is he serious? Or is he just covering his ass cause he started me on Geodon. Idk man. I am literally ranting because this is actually the only place I feel safe to do this. Seriously, I made this account to vent but always find myself shutting down and helping others but this sub is different for me. Idk why. 

Anyways, while I feel totally validated in a way I also had such a breakdown yesterday with all the intense feelings I engaged in some old behaviors that I thought were completely of the past. I feel hopeless and hopeful, scared and angry. Relieved and defective. Proud of myself while also hating myself. Such a mind fuck. I always felt a sense of hope and comfort by the fact that BPD is “the good prognosis diagnosis”. Patients who commit to treatment can stop the meeting criteria in 10 years. It’s really something you can completely recover from and I saw that light in that tunnel but now..... I’m always going to be sick. And I guess that’s where my pain lies...."
BPD,"GF (22) and I (M, 22) breaking up because of career locations I've been dating her for a little over 2 years now. Really thought she was gonna be the person I marry. This was the first healthy relationship I've ever had, and also the longest. Communication was amazing. The connection is amazing. I love her so much, and I know she loves me. But while I head to a different state to get my master's and PsyD in clinical psych, she's going to stay where we are and study law and become an attorney. We're both very passionate and educated for our age in the fields we want to go into, and I know both of us will be successful, but it feels like I have a hole in my heart now. She was definitely my FP. The only person I've ever trusted that much. She knows me better than anyone else in the entire world. 

I only have a month left before we graduate and move on. And the breakup is conscious and made with love, I want her to be fulfilled in her life and do what's best for her, even if that means I can't go with her. This is one of the hardest things I'll ever have to do. It doesn't seem like I'll ever find that type of connection again.... I just feel hopeless in that aspect. She has never lied to me, always told me how it was, and would admit when she was wrong, and I did the same. Unconditional acceptance and love on both ends. I feel so many different emotions towards her, that she's abandoning me, that I'm stupid for thinking she'd want to spend her life with someone like me. But in reality she feels horrible for doing this to me, she really does love and proves that every time I see her, when she could've just cut me off. Both of us want to go through this process of separation together in a sense, and I don't mean that in a way of we pretend like it's all okay, but rather we talk about how we feel about it and things of that sort. I told her from the jump, I can't fight her battles, and she can't fight mine, but I'll be in her corner. And she always tells me she's in mine. And we're keeping it that way till the end.

It's so natural for us to want to put a face to the reason why bad things happen, and it's so normal for our emotions and feelings of abandonment to come up in a roaring storm when we're going through something like this. But sometimes, it's not a person. That's what this is showing me. It's not because of me, and it's not because of her, that's just life. 

And for the things we cannot control, we must accept, no matter the pain. I will experience many dark nights of absolute sobbing and horrific emotions and thoughts. I will experience emptiness to a whole new degree. I will feel depressed, defeated, and hopeless. But I will prevail, through allowing my emotions, through being mindful, and through self exploration and acceptance. If there's anything I've learned from her, it's that I am worthy and deserving of love. I hope I showed her the same, because she will have a place in my heart until the day I die."
BPD,Bad at comforting people? Not sure if this is bpd related but I just suck at comforting people. I have a friend who talks to me and has really intense emotions/reactions as well. I just don’t know how to react and my mind goes blank. I really feel his pain and feel upset as well but I don’t know what to say?? He called me crying and I just panicked. Maybe it’s because i don’t have any long term friendships. I just don’t understand how I can be so emotional yet be so unhelpful when someone else is going through it? I feel like bpd experience should help me not hurt me here and I’m just looking for advice or insight.
BPD,"Sorry, tmi? So I was diagnosed with BPD back in September, and I think I just found the right med combination. 

Why? 

Because I went from absolutely despising myself and wanting to die and hating looking at myself with no sex drive to horny 25/8 and constantly taking pictures of myself and showing off to my boyfriend. 

Is this a “good” sign? I just changed meds for the third time since September and the past few weeks that I’ve been taking olanzapine makes me think it seems to be my new miracle med."
BPD,"Did therapy help some people feel their emotions less intensely? I am not diagnosed, but I have several BPD traits and my last therapist told me after a personality test that the results would be sufficient to some therapists to diagnose me (and then she ditched me 🥲). I've suspected this for years anyway. I've recently started trying medication (sertraline then Wellbutrin). Sertraline helped with emotional reactivity. For once, my emotions felt like a mere pinch instead of a burning knife stuck in my guts and that was awesome. Now that I switched medications (because of side effects), I feel more motivated and I have more energy which is nice, but the emotions are coming back and I snapped at someone I love again last night. I hate this x) my doctor keeps telling me to go to therapy again, saying that the way I feel emotions can change but I seriously doubt that. 

So I was wondering if anyone had any luck feeling less attacked by their emotions after therapy or if you just learned to cope and not react while still feeling the same."
BPD,"Spending money to feel worth. Who else struggles with this? What makes it worse for me is:
I’m a college student with little income
I’m in credit card debt bc of it
My parent can see my bank account and reads my transactions out loud in front of the family and this only makes me feel shamed and humiliated. 
I don’t know what my their goal is with doing this, but I cried for a long time last night because I know I only spend to feel worthy to myself."
BPD,"how do you deal with repetitive noises? my neighbors have three dogs they leave outside all day, every day. their incessant, and i do mean that literally, barking is really causing me a lot of discomfort. how do you handle repetitive, intrusive noise? or do you know how i can make this specific situation stop?"
BPD,"My friend killed herself yesterday. She killed herself in the dark, her parents found her dead. We got the news earlier today. She was the kind of girl who will give you the love and the respext you deserved. She showed us how to love and how to see the beauty in the ugly. I'm sad and I don't know what to do with that. I just hope she finds the peace she was looking for."
BPD,"DAE feel helpless against the lack of self-control? Like, I know when my actions will have negative consequences, it’s not that I can’t see right from wrong. But even when I know my actions can hurt others, or cause me to self-destruct, I still justify it in some way."
BPD,"Nobody cares about me I’m trying to get help. Like so hard. But I feel so fucking empty inside. Nobody fucking cares about me. Today, I texted my best friend and asked if she would stop by my dorm to say hi while she was on campus. Instead of a yes or no, I got a whole fucking lecture. “Why do i need to? It won’t do anything. You’ll still be miserable. And you’re gonna want a hug.” That hurt so bad. I just missed my best friend and wanted to see her. I wasn’t gonna tell her my emotions or ask for a hug or anything. I just want to see her. I just want to know that somebody still cares the way I care for them. Like yeah seeing her for 5 min won’t fix me but it’s still seeing somebody for 5 min. I’ve been all alone for all my free time recently and I just want one person to be there for me. Just one. I know I fucked a lot of things up in the past but I just want to know that I haven’t lost everything. She claims she’s gonna stick around but seeing as she can’t even say hi to me, I don’t know. I’m so lost. I just want this horrible life to end. I’m so lonely. I just want to be wanted my someone"
BPD,"I was Diagnosed on my first week of Junior Year. Last Monday began my Junior year experience and on Wednesday I was diagnosed with Borderline personality disorder. I say ""diagnosed"" but my psychologist already knew I had this illness since February but decided not to tell me so I wouldn't worry. She said she wasn't duty-bound, legally to tell me I have BPD until I turn 18 (Next May) so she was waiting for me to find out because she said she knew I was smart enough to do so.

What my psychologist doesn't know is that I didn't just randomly came across something that was wrong with me... I was doing several quizzes online about how bisexual I was, just for fun (I was 40% lesbian, 60% straight) and I saw a quiz called ""Do you have Borderline Personality disorder?"" My interest was piqued so I clicked out of boredom and became instantly scared for what the quizz was describing and I didn't even finish it because I texted my psychologist and that's when everything went down.

As for how did I take it; I was destroyed. She told me the symptoms and I had it all... Untrusting, Mood Swings, Self Harm, Intrusive Thoughts, Black and White Thinking, Body dysmorphia, Fear of Abandonment, Dissociation and derealization, Indecisiveness, Intense emotions and Emptiness.

My psychologist asked me if this made me sad and I said no but my body betrayed me because that second a tear rolled down my eye.

People might think it's silly to be sad in that moment because they think it's because you're putting a label on yourself, but it's hard not to when 90% of what you are is your illness... that's what they call it ""personality disorder"" isn't it?

I feel really bad for myself because I have a crush and he has been flirting with me this past week and until Wednesday, I felt like I could be happy for once.... but no... I would never put him through the pain of being with someone with BPD, because he is funny, positive, charming and caring... I would feel responsible for the pain he would go through because of being with me."
BPD,"When the abused becomes the abuser TL;DR: I unknowingly traumatized my favorite person  and I feel awful

As a child I was severely emotionally and mentally abused and exploited. I was also very mildly sexually and physically abused. As a result, I'm a very fucked up person who has a very fucked up view on the world. I developed BPD when I was 10 and got diagnosed this January at the age of 15. Getting diagnosed has given me a lot of time to do some self reflection and assessment of my flaws. I've made huge progress to become a better person, but, I still fucked up.

My favorite person who I've known for three or four years and I were talking last night. He opened up to me about the abuse and trauma I put him through while I was undiagnosed and unaware of what I was doing. I exploited his trust and used it for my own personal gain, and went to extreme lengths to do so.  I would even hit him on a few occasions if he pissed me off, which was very easy to do. I emotionally manipulated him and made efforts to cut off his other friends and I would stalk him to make sure he wasn't talking to them. I didn't know what I was doing was wrong. I'm not trying to make excuses but I've gone through severe trauma, especially with people I love leaving me. I was petrified of him leaving me. And, in order to prevent that imagined fear, I fucked him up. And at some points I knew I was a toxic person but I never addressed it. And whenever my friend would speak up about the shit I was pulling, I would either gaslight him, go into a suicidal rampage and blame him for it, or accept it but not do anything about it. Whenever he expressed his emotions I'd ignore them and make it about myself.

I'm glad I'm not that person anymore, but god I feel awful. I cant believe I became the person I feared most. I didnt mean to, I really didnt. Thankfully we're on really good terms now because I've made efforts to not be that toxic bitch anymore, but I feel so bad.  And growing up as a victim of abuse, I can't believe I put someone who I love and care about through that. I have left him traumatized and it's my fault. I wish I could go back and change it all because he didnt deserve it. I wish I understood what I was doing wrong. 

And god I fucked him up good. He flinches every time I go to touch him. He gets random anxiety attacks around me. He slips away into dissociative episodes easily when at my house. He avoids telling me about his mental state because he doesn't feel like I'm a safe person to go to. He can't say no to anything anyone tells him anymore, because when he did it was ignored. When my tone changes around him, it triggers a panic attack. I honestly cant believe I did that to a person. I feel so ashamed and disgusted. 

I cant believe I became a monster. The same monster that fucked me up as a child. I feel so guilty and I want to cry. I'm so thankful that we're on good terms now and he forgives me, but I cant forgive myself."
BPD,"Best countries to live in with BPD As the United States has become a sad place for those of us that struggle with serious mental disorders, not to mention the nightmare caused by Trump and our political system since 2016, I’ve started wondering about other places that might be more hospitable or at least empathetic to those of us with BPD.  I do well in my job and make good money, but my company-sponsored healthcare does not cover my very expensive DBT program, so I’m paying $350/week out of pocket.  And then there is the stigma.

What other counties are there that are most accepting and have better health care options where a US citizen may be able to live and work?"
BPD,"DAE crave friendships and a feeling of belonging, but whenever somebody reaches out you put your walls up? I’m realizing that making friends is such a hurdle for me due to my habit of isolating myself for fear of rejection/abandonment. I will get excited when a coworker I like adds me on Facebook, but then whenever they actually attempt to converse with me I clam up. 

I get nervous about them seeing my posts and thinking I’m stupid or fake, because I behave differently at work (I find it hard to show my true self at work, and behave as a quiet and serious person but on Facebook I will share my humor). I also get afraid that the more they speak with me, the more boring they will think I am and end up judging and abandoning me. 

I’m also afraid to reveal too much about myself because I’m afraid that they will use it against me or laugh about it with others behind my back. 

But I think what I fear the most about it is that I don’t even know how to be myself. I feel like I have no true personality and I never know what to say or how to react to things. I don’t even like who I am, so why would anyone else?"
BPD,"Reducing impulsive behavior and anger has left me generally empty and now I don’t know how to be assertive in a healthy way either I’m heavily struggling with some personal stuff right now which may be contributing to some of my problems. A close friend of mine who I haven’t seen in a few years has developed schizophrenia, and has been recently committed to a facility just this past week. I’m retroactively finding out all of these really upsetting things that have happened to her and disturbing behaviors she’s exhibited out of psychosis. It’s extremely upsetting for me because I knew her when she was well. It’s incredibly jarring and my heart is broken. I feel like I’m mourning someone who is still alive. This is happening at the exact same time as I’m being broken up with very recently by my now-ex/FP. If that’s not hard enough, my good friend is dating him now, and he’s being completely vile towards me. I’ve been motionless and angry and incredibly depressed. I’m actually HAVING to make myself drink a little alcohol (I’m not a drinker or much of a substance user in general) just to make myself calm down, get to sleep, etc. 

I’ve felt proud recently for the progress I’ve made in therapy. I followed my worksheets pretty closely and learned how to stop myself before angrily blowing up his phone, or generally externalizing and being highly impulsive. But now that those habits are gone, I don’t know how to cope with the feelings that caused those explosive outbursts before hand. It’s like I’ve just whipped myself into not causing more headache for myself and others. But now I have this huge burden present. 
For example, this situation with my friend and my ex. I don’t know how to talk to him about this or appropriately be angry at him. I’m not possessing the reason or decisiveness to know that I shouldn’t talk to him. I’m just basically not texting him and he’s not texting me. I don’t know how to confront my friend. She’s been subposting about dating him and about me. Since people basically grift off of plausible deniability, I haven’t been able to do anything more than ask her once in response to an obviously targeted Instagram story, “what are you getting at with these posts?”. To which I got no reply.  Then yesterday she sends me this sappy HNY text. And I’m like bitch, what the fuck? Now you feel bad? I just ignored her. I don’t know what to do or say. 

I’m depressed and I don’t know how to go after the things that make me feel better. Long term or short term. I’ve hit up friends just to chat hoping it would cheer me up, and they just don’t respond. Can’t control that but I’m lonely and I need someone and it couldn’t be a worse time to feel unwanted. My (what feel like normal) attempts at socializing with my friends are just starting to feel like dumb actions that only lead to my own embarrassment, and that I just need to never text anyone ever again. And I’d say “wait for them to hit me up first”, but they never hit me up first anyway and I’m sure weeks would go by. I will just be alone until I’m lovable. I need to design a giving, beautiful, impressive self and basically become a doll. Only then will anyone love me I believe because obviously I’m not lovable now. I had nothing to do yesterday and decided to do something good for myself by trying out some new music equipment. Doing anything hard for myself like that feels like someone placing a 200 lb dumbbell in front of me and asking me to lift it. 9/10 times I fucking can’t and it’s why I have nothing going for myself. It’s so hard. 

I don’t know what to do."
BPD,"I don’t meet my boyfriend’s standard I feel like I don’t fit in what my boyfriend likes in a girl. Not only I feel, but I know. When I asked him about things he finds attractive in a girl he said pale skin, small frame, skinny and flat stomach, small boobs and short height, straight hair. Out of that, I’m only short height and maybe pale skin. Also, all the girls he followed met those characteristics, even when he shared with me which porn channels he watched. There weren’t any chubby looking girls or very far from what he described (the most different was probably a girl with bigger boobs and butt) I don’t know how to believe he likes my body type when I ask him to describe things he finds attractive and I can’t find any of my own characteristics in there. 
I’m honestly really heartbroken and don’t know how to feel. He keeps saying he prefers me yet his actions prove the opposite."
BPD,When BPD makes you feel... Empty. So empty and bored and lonely. Like you try to fill the void but nothing is good enough. Nothing is satisfying enough. Then the fact that life is just so predictable. I need some spontaneity in my life ASAP. And I'm feeling risky like I wanna have $3x with a stranger. Ugh!
BPD,"Started a new relationship; paranoid already Does anyone know how I can be less paranoid and more trusting in my boyfriend? I feel awful, I know I should trust him, he hasn’t given me a reason not to, but I can’t help it. I got really paranoid the other day and said something to him about it, he took the battery right out of his phone and threw it. I ended up dissociating right afterwards; so the next few minutes were a blur (it happens to me a lot with people throwing things, because of my ex) but I remember him crying and feeling so bad. I know he cares, but I just can’t make the feelings stop. I feel like he’s going to get sick of me acting like this and leave."

autism,"How do I help my autistic friend? I'm desperate Hi sorry if it's not ok for a neurotypical to post here. I really need help with how to support my autistic best friend, K. Sorry if long. He also has ADHD, OCD, and depression. He is dealing with a powerful fixation on this girl, T. Were all late twenties. K has a girlfriend but is kind of in love with T. He claims it's just platonic but acknowledges he's attracted to her but it's so much more than that. They were friends before for a year and then got in a fight and didn't talk for 10 months. During that 10 months he was so depressed. He tanked his classes he stopped going to the gym, barely went outside. He talked about it nonstop. We'd be on the phone for 4-6 hours and when I'd try and end the call he'd get so depressed and say he's sorry for talking about it. I got the feeling he genuinely couldn't stop. It was so draining for me because it was constant but I was so worried about him I felt like I couldn't say no.

T is back. I have no idea why but she reached out to him on insta and they're friends again. She is really toxic always has been. They fight constantly, she gaslights him, yells at him for his symptoms, she screams at him till her eyes are popping out and she criticizes him for every little thing. I can not at all understand why he would want this person in his life but he says she's like his heroin and even he doesn't understand it. He says he fixates on her like a puzzle, trying to figure out what to say that will get a positive response. I've told him there is no way to get a positive response, she will never change, she will always hurt him. He says he cannot stop the relationship. I can't go through him being depressed and the hours long phone calls and worrying he's suicidal again. He's in therapy but tbh I think his therapist is useless. He's been going to her for a decade and I think she's asleep at the wheel. 

I know exposure therapy is the best way to overcome OCD fixation, but K says that doesn't work for autism fixation he says it makes it worse and there is no cure. Surely there has to be something. Not a 'cure' but a coping mechanism, *something*. How can I make him break this fixation please. Have any of you experienced a fixation like this? Have you been able to break it? What can help?? Anything? Please I haven't been able to find anything online. I love him and want him to be ok and he's ruining himself by staying in this toxic ass relationship"
autism,"Quitting a hobby due to burnout but feeling guilty Hello people, this is my first ever post on here. But I need to make a decision and thought that my fellow aspies could help me. 
I was diagnosed with Asperger’s several years ago at 13 years old (now I’m 17) and struggled with autistic burnout about three times since then. But this may be my fourth episode. I know the only way to get better is to reduce stress and my activities. Im still in school and of course can’t cut out my responsibilities in that regard, also I can’t quit therapy which takes up an afternoon a week, also I’m learning to drive and can’t reduce that. So the only Activity I could quit is dancing. I dance twice a week (ballet and jazz) and really love both. But ballet is stressing me out recently. I’m dancing since I’m three years old and would do anything not to quit, especially as I also struggle with not feeling good enough if I don’t do as many activities as possible. But I also know that I need to quit something in order to be happy again. 
I really don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m breaking up with someone or in this case something I love and feel some sort of grief. 
I love it on one hand and am stressed on the other. Any advice for me?"

In the meantime I am wearing for the first time my Old Rose colored jeans. So he must have thought we were two gay men walking there until he notices my ex is a woman and suddenly then it is okay. I must not be gay after all...

Old Rose isn't really pink, but it is a color unsuited for men. Men cannot wear certain colors or motifs. 

And this incident just shows how unusual it is to wear a color not specifically intended for men, like navy blue would be."

autism,"I May Have a Date! Hey everyone :) I’ve been out of the dating game for three years now and was diagnosed with ADHD and Autism a month or two ago. I get overwhelmed in crowds and restaurants pretty easily sensory wise and can shut down in busy areas trying to mask. I’m sure everyone here can relate.

My question: what are sensory and autism friendly date ideas I can propose to this fella? He has has asked me out a few times now and I think I’m ready to jump into the dating pool again. Any suggestions are welcome in the general subject of dating with autism/ADHD. Thanks everyone!"
autism,Autism and pain Hello I was wondering if self inflicting pain is common with autism. See I have this tiny desire to conflict pain on my self  that I should and probably will bring up to my therapist. I know it is not related to my depression cause I don't do it when deppresed but I think it has something to do with control over myself and from what I heard that probably would be related to my autism. So do you guys have the same or similar problem.
autism,"Is this ASD/ADHD or something else? Hi! So, often, when I'm answering questions or reading something, I like to articulate myself. For example, I have been starting to get on Reddit more often because I legit love this subreddit but anyway, often I can only answer a few things in depth (commenting or writing a few things in depth) before I just socially die. I get to a point where, even though I want to say so many more things and talk to so many more people, I also don't. I get to a point where I'm done with social media and just do anything else. I think it might be understimulation but that also doesn't make sense because even when I want to respond, I'm also dreading it and too tired to put in more depth. It's so confusing. And as I was saying before, it's the same with reading. I could be really into a book (currently The Face On The Milk Carton) and wanna read more but motivation and energy are deaadd. And just now, I wanted to do a voice call with a friend, I did it for maybe 50 minutes before they left, but I have these bouts of ""I don't want to do this/be here anymore. Leave me alone. Say you want me to leave."" etc. God. Normally I'd write more but I'm in that kinda state. Anywho, bye."

autism,"Maths is too hard, am I the issue? I'm almost at tenth grade and I've absolutely no capability to deal with the math work provided, I even get the easier stuff because I'm on a learning plan but sometimes the work is so difficult not even my SLSO (assigned aid) is capable of doing it, everyone else seems able to do it, am I the issue here or is maths just too hard for everyone?"
autism,"when I get upset and am crying, I can’t verbalize anything. It is so hard and I hate it. (Long post) so a few nights ago, my boyfriend (20M) and I (19F) were talking about me wanting to go back to college next semester for a B.S. in Psychology and then leading up to an M.S. in Clinical Psychology. I had wrote down an entire plan on how I thought it would work, which of my credits from my Associates degree would transfer to the bachelors degree, how much the time spent completing my bachelors would decrease since I would have so many credits that would transfer, and how long overall it would take to complete the bachelors and masters program. I estimated it would take around 4.5 years. Going to college again and becoming a psychologist is my dream and I would be incredibly happy if I could ever fulfill it sometime during my life. My special interest is abnormal psychology, and I am serious when I say it is all I ever want.

My boyfriend, who I’ve been with for 3 years and 3 months, who is also autistic, really snapped me back into reality and I wasn’t ready to hear it. He goes to the same college I have been wanting to go to for this Bachelor’s program, and he’s starting on his 3rd year in his B.S. in Mechanical Engineering. I’m pretty sure he is set on getting his Masters as well. I thought we would both be able to graduate at the same time, since masters programs typically take 2 years to complete. It turns out his is only going to take a year since the M.S. in Engineering is only 30ish credits long, and mine would take more around 2 because the M.S. in Psychology is 48 credits long. I didn’t know the programs went by how many credits they included. Anyway, it basically wouldn’t work for me to go back to school immediately upon graduation with my Associates degree and graduate at the same time as my boyfriend. The reason why it’s important for us to graduate at the same time, or close to it, is because he would need to get a job upon immediately graduating and the place where we will be living for the next few years has no mechanical engineering opportunities, so we would have to move soon after he graduates and gets a job elsewhere. If I was to go back to school next semester, I’d be holding him back a year and it wouldn’t work. My SAT/ACT scores also aren’t good enough for any scholarships or grants because I hadn’t yet been diagnosed with ADHD or Autism while I was in high school, so I had no accommodations or anything. That was another thing that made me really upset, and I felt like a failure for not doing better. I always ran out of time on every section and cried during every test because running out of time was so stressful. My parents also made “too much money” in 2020 for me to receive any federal student aid besides another shitty loan, even though my dad lost his job in 2021 and had to receive unemployment benefits until getting confirmation whether or not he would receive occupational disability. 

When he told me all of this, I just started crying. I was so upset and I felt hopeless in finding happiness through my dream occupation. I could not stop crying because I have such strong and overwhelming emotions that it makes it nearly impossible to control. It got so overwhelming actually that I’m pretty sure I was having a meltdown looking back on it. I was barely talking to him, not because I was mad at him, but because I just could not get any words out. I was thinking of so many things to say but every time I would get ready to say them, I would start crying again. After an hour of just laying my head on his chest and him listening to me sniffle and cry occasionally, I could finally say “I have so much on my mind that I want to say but I can’t verbalize it so I need to write them down”. Even then while saying that, it felt so hard and I started to get super upset and overwhelmed again near the end of saying it. So he handed me a pen and I wrote everything. 

It made me feel so much better being able to say what I was thinking without saying it. I just hate not being able to say anything when I get upset like that. It’s embarrassing, frustrating, and I wish I could just hold it in but I can’t. It is actually impossible. Do any of you guys get like this too?"

""Virtual Ability"" island in Second Life   
""Autcraft"" server for Minecraft

Maybe you know more of these kind of places? Maybe in VRChat or different platforms? Maybe you know some Second Life islands of creators with ASD? It doesn't necessarily have to be about gaming, i.e. ""Virtual Ability"" hosts a lot of different topic events for talks, just in virtual world and I find it fascinating. 

I am eager to learn any kind of information, but maybe it would be helpful for some of this community members as well?

bipolar,"Appointment tomorrow. I've been waiting a month to go back. Tomorrow's the big day! I wish I was as excited as I am nervous. When I left my psychiatrist's office last month, I was bawling all the way out of the office and no one cared lmao. I told myself I wouldn't go back and that doctors and medicine are all fucking crooks. I still feel that way but I haven't gotten any calls back from other doctors in my area. I'm kind of stuck seeing her until I can switch. I've been seeing her since September 2018. She's tried 2 medicines on me and both didn't work out. I have since been unmedicated because she doesn't know what to prescribe me at this point. She suggested therapy and I have been trying to find a therapist in my area for a few months. No one has called me back. (I've been calling people about a week after I initially get a hold of a human on the phone. They keep telling me to wait for a call.)   


My posts here are all the same but I have no one to talk to about shit that drags me down. I'm scared that tomorrow she's gonna provoke me. She tried my last appointment. I almost walked out but I told myself ""This is what she wants. She wants you to leave because you aren't capable of being helped."" I stayed because in my mind, I wanted to make her job harder. I wanted her to have to scratch her head and work for her fucking money. Instead of passing prescriptions to people willy nilly not giving a fuck how they feel. About who they are as a person. I've never been one to be aggressive or rude to anyone in public. She makes me want to punch myself in the face with frustration.  


My point is, something is wrong with me but who fucking cares. No doctor has ever come up with something that has helped and all therapists stop seeing me because I need medicine. Lmao I've been thrown back and forth to these professionals only to be told THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU BUT YOU'RE VERY MENTALLY ILL. Like yeah, it's a REAL problem isn't it? Only no one gives a fuck. I'd give anything to die peacefully. To not have been born. To not have anything wrong with me mentally. I'm sorry to anyone out there that might be offended by what I say. I'm just mad. Everyone gets mad. I'm always mad now. Ugh.

bipolar,"How do you guys differentiate effects of medication and improved confidence from inflated self-esteem? Lately, I’ve had quite an upswing self-esteem wise and I’m feeling a lot better about myself. It’s like I’ve stopped tolerating bullshit anymore and I frankly could care less about others. I went from being at an all time low following a breakup, crying every day, feeling like I’d never be able to function again and other chaotic stuff in my life, to just becoming more appreciative of the way things have turned out. I can’t believe I’ve wasted time feeling so down about everything because of things not being the way I want them to instead of making them happen. I can’t tell if me being quarantined has had a positive or negative effect on me, but it’s left me with more time to do all the stuff I’ve ever wanted to. I dropped out of my major and got accepted into Med School, got put on new medication to manage mania and upped my dose of antidepressants. Things finally seem to be going my way and I’m spending more time drawing, writing and listening to music etc. I will never accept less than I deserve. Like I don’t need anyone but myself. I feel great, but I don’t know how much I can trust it. Generally, when I’m manic, I find this far more unpleasant because I grow tired of it pretty fast. Is this what being normal feels like?"
bipolar,"Bit of a lurker but I had the most unnerving conversation over New Years. “Do you really want to take medication?” “You can’t really be yourself on medication”

“Are you sure you want to be bipolar the rest of your life?”

“Remember that really bizarre thing you said while you were manic but I won’t believe you were manic?”

It’s been a year since I had the worst manic episode I’ve had (slightly drug induced) and in two weeks it’ll be a year since I was hospitalized. I was hospitalized for a broken hand because I punched a door hard enough for the bone to pop out of my hand. That’s besides the fact I pretty much forgot my name by that point. Oh, and there’s a video of me shooting a firework out of my mouth going 80 mph down the highway. It was a fun kind of mania but I lost respect from people and lost my girlfriend so yes, I’m kind of over remembering it. 

You know what the opposite of what I wanted this New Years? To be stuck in the room with my friend who just kept on pestering me about the legitimacy of what I struggle with. “You’d be fine without medication” you know what? With counciling and a stable lifestyle probably. But unfortunately I’m in college, it’s stressful, and I can’t manage myself. You don’t know what I go through. 

“Are you sure you want to struggle with that for your entire life?”

I’ll say here what I said to him. I was in denial in high school. I was in denial early college. Back then I didn’t do drugs and I was a pessimistic isolationist so it was easy to manage. Now I smoke, drink, and take vyvanse so I need to manage myself more. Two weeks of severe mania was all I needed as proof. I’m honestly surprised I didn’t kill myself in a car crash. Luckily this time I didn’t think about suicide because of all the new people I’d met in college and just knowing mom would be sad. 

DO NOT TRY TO BRING UP WHAT I DID WHILE MANIC. 

I STILL CRINGE WHILE TRYING TO FALL ASLEEP AT THOSE MEMORIES. 

TWO WEEKS INTENSIVE COUNSILING AND A VERY GOOD PSYCH GOT ME HERE. DO NOT TEAR ME DOWN.

bipolar,"Bipolar Cycling Is it common to have two consecutive hypomanic episodes with a 2 month period in between? until now it's always been depressed, hypo, depressed hypo back and forth."
bipolar,"How do you know if someone is having an episode? Before I met my ex girlfriend, she was very sexually active but also extremely depressed. She always had multiple partners and would let people ""use her"". She couldn't explain why, and admitted that it wasn't smart, safe, or even satisfying. Meeting me, we began to work through her issues. She expressed how the intimacy we share bypasses her past hook ups by far. 

We discovered that she suffered from bipolar disorder on the same day we discovered she was pregnant with our child. Needless to say, we've had our ups and downs for sure, but our love for each other and our child always helped us get back on track.

That child is now four years old, and we separated four months ago due to some petty argument. We reconciled to an extent, with her telling me she loves me and wants to be with me at the end of the day. However, her sexual urges have practically exploded and she returned to wanting to have multiple partners. 

I explained to her that I wasn't willing to share her, or sit around and wait for her to stop doing these things. I gave her the ultimatum of me or them, and even though I got an angry response, a sad response, an aloof response, and everything in between, I didn't get a real answer. I figured that no answer was enough of an answer and I decided that I would just have to accept reality and move on from the relationship.

I talked to a few people about my decision and everyone had different views. Some of them felt she was being incredibly selfish and manipulative. Some felt that its her body and I should mind my own business. Some told me that I was foolish for not following the rule of ""never wife a ho"". All of these responses, positive or negative, felt useless to me because none of them factored in that she suffers from a mental disorder. 

I feel a huge sense of responsibility because I've not only been her lover for these past 5 years, but her caretaker as well. I pushed her to go to therapy, and to consider meds, and to remove toxic people from her life. But even after 5 years, I still only know so much about how bipolar disorder manifests. 

Everything that has happened seems to line up with the symptom of hypersexuality, along with some of the things I read about empathy. But how do I know? How do I know this isn't just a grown woman making her own decisions? How do I know when it's time to give up and walk away?"

It reminds me a lot of the terrible dreams I had as a child , or when I was on ambien, but lately they are relentless. I wake up in a cold sweat and dread going back to sleep because I know the nightmare will start from where it left off.

bipolar,"hydroxyzine I have been experiencing these...cataclysmic panic attacks recently (stress from school), so my psych prescribed me lorazepam (which I have taken before), and hydroxyzine (which I have never heard of).

I have taken lorazepam for acute events only, and that's what I am going to do again with it...can I do the same thing with hydroxyzine? I drink alcohol and don't really want to be stuffing my body with these things all the time vs. once a week, as needed."
bipolar,"Looking for advice. Family member in manic state for almost 2 months Hi y’all,
A member of my family has been manic for close to 2 months now.  Apparently made worse by steroids that were prescribed. I am extremely worried but unsure how to address this. She thinks everything is ok because her house is clean, she’s flying and cleaning at all hours of the day and night. She has also been extremely confrontational and forgetful (screaming, cussing us out over perceived slights and telling the same stories or making the same “suggestions” dozens of times) She refuses to admit that anything is wrong. Taking herself to the doctor would do no good since everything we are concerned about is “just her personality”.  and wouldn’t be discussed during the visit. But this is not the person I grew up with and I’m scared for her.  Is it true that being in a prolonged manic state can damage her brain?  How do we get through to her doctor without enraging her? I’ve tried talking to her about it but rational thought seems to be out the window. Has anyone else ever gone through something like this before? Any suggestions on how to get through to her? It’s affecting everyone in the family but it seems most are ok with waiting for her to come back down rather than confront her (for fear of blowing up the family) I want to help her now though"
bipolar,"Does anyone have experience in lowering their Lithium dosage? I'm taking 1200mg right now. And I swear I'm drinking *at least* 10 liters of water per day. This is 2.6 US Gallons according to Google.

I was in a depressive episode at the time, but now I'm on the ""happy side"" of things. My doctor already lowered the dosage of buprion to 150mg too.

depression,"went on a picnic with a prostitute and broke down crying Took an escort on a picnic date. I spent hours preparing for it. I went to buy a picnic basket, a blanket, a stereo, cards, flowers. I went to 3 different places to get food. I got sushi, cake, milk tea, crackers, cheese, fruit. I went to the park and laid it all out and made it nice for her. When she got there she was gorgeous. I was really nervous and giddy at the same time. Embarasssing. I just couldn't stop smiling. I was living the fantasy of a 14 year old girl. Only I was a 27 year old man. It hit me like a truck when I realized that. I felt terrible. Like I missed out on my youth and was too old to do this stuff anymore. Not only that but I'm a man. I'm not allowed to like this kind of stuff. I thought to myself ""she must think I'm such a creep."" I began tearing up in front of her and ultimately cried into her boobs. She seemed confused but not that confused almost like she was used to it. I couldn't even enjoy the picnic after that because I was too embrassed. Feel ashamed of myself.

TL;DR: I feel like I missed out on young love and it's devastating.  And I also feel like a beta male. I'm ashamed of myself."
depression,"I just want to disappear. Did you ever had the feeling like the universe is conspiring against you? These past five years have been absolutely fucking horrible. I mean one year is fine but five fucking years, man. I don’t know what to do anymore. Everytime I try to stand up, something is always pulling me down. I ask myself what have I done to deserve this shit? 

I just want to pack my bags and go somewhere I can start over. I just want to ghost everyone I know and start over. Is it selfish of me? Maybe.  I think it would be better for everyone. I admit I’m toxic sometimes but I try to be better whenever I see myself lashing out on someone. 

Maybe I just need someone to talk to. Someone who I can go home to and talk about my day. Someone I can hold hands with. I don’t know. Fuck. I hope this streak of bad luck ends now. "
depression,"I Might Leave Soon This is probably my last year here, to be honest I don't think I can handle staying with my family anymore, my mental issues are over the roof and no one and nothing is helping anymore, everyday seems like the same day is repeating over and over again, my gender and sexuality confuse me and I can't talk about them to my parents they're very phobic about it. Since everything is getting difficult i might as well just leave, everything is going to be better if I Leave anything and theres not point.

Thanks"
depression,goddamn i’m so fucking depressed and useless i cant do anything but sit around all day and cry and sleep and waste my parents time and energy and money. i want to do something like get a job or at least volunteer or better myself as a person but i can barely wake up for school every day. i’m so fucking useless i don’t know what to do and i don’t even have the energy to kill myself. fuck.
depression,"It's taken me so long to realize that I'm toxic.. It took me a long time to realize it, but I now believe that I could be the issue when it comes to personal relationships in my life. It's hard for me to admit and believe that I could be the problem, but now that I look back on everything, I always did play the victim. 

I realize I don't take other people's feelings into consideration if it doesn't benefit me. I talk to anyone how I want when I am angry. If they hurt my feelings...I'm ready to attack. I feel as if I'm entitled to people bowing down to my needs. My mother always told me this. My brother cut me off for good. A lot of my friends left my side. I disrespected people in ways that I did not need to. 

I don't really know what's wrong with me. I'm sad, but for some reason I'm not so sad. I am very generous and giving, but when I am not fond of something or if something makes me unhappy, I take a 180 to a darker side of me. I tend to blame people for my feelings. 

A man that I was very fond of even told me how he notices that I crave control and power. When things don't go my way, I become this self entitled brat and I hurt feelings, but when I'm happy and feel mentally good, I am 'the best female he's ever laid eyes on'. 

I don't understand why I am this way. As I'm typing this I'm upset, I want to fix the important relationships in my life, especially my family. I tend to be selfish when I'm upset, but I'm super giving when I'm feeling okay. I don't know what it is. 

I did go through a lot through the years I've lived so far. I would have to explain. I seen things I wasn't supposed to see, especially as a child. I used to be abused by my biological parent (who I don't speak to anymore), I was bullied a lot in school due to being overweight. My one and only past relationship was very abusive and toxic. I was physically taken advantage of by a family member when I was a little girl. My babysitter when I was younger used to beat me. There was a lot of hurt that I experienced, but I don't know if that's why I am the way I am.

I am not evil. I will not hurt anyone on purpose. It's the way I treat people. It's my attitude and words that hurt people when I'm angry at them. I don't know what's going on with me, but I think I have a lot of hurt that I need to get rid of, but for some reason I am just not facing them. I should probably talk to a professional. 

TL;DR I think I'm realizing who I am. I want to change this negative side of me. Feel free to state your opinions."
depression,"Anybody on disability? Because of their depression?

Obviously people who have other ailments and end up on disability can be prone to depression, but is anyone on here on disability specifically because of their depression?

I have a bachelors degree, and I’ve left two different graduate programs because of my depression/anxiety. But I can’t seem to stay in a job longer than a few months. I start off strong, excited, etc, but I eventually end up shutting down, calling off repeatedly, and eventually quitting. I’ve never been fired, but I’m worried I’m getting close to unemployable, aside from not being able to attend once I get a job.

I just quit my job today. 

I know it can be a pain in the butt, and is far from ideal... idk... I’d appreciate any thoughts on the matter

But this event, I ended up being first in the event which was a surprise to me. It didn't occur to me until after everyone was asking me how I stayed motivated that it came to me that if I failed I would have to think about how much I hated myself. I can't stop thinking about it.

Thinking on it, I can’t survive on my own. She brought up instances in the past where I was able to do things on my own and she told me I couldn’t do them now. She’s right.

I don’t belong in this world. I have nothing to contribute but negativity. I break myself trying to succeed and I fail every time. I never became an adult. I will amount to nothing."
depression,"I got some help.... I hope this is allowed I read the rules and I Dont think it breaks any ? 

But I did it, I reached out to someone, my sister and she helped me to get help for my depression from a doctor. 

I've been suffering for years and got treatment In the past but the last 18-24 months has just broke something inside me, I don't care anymore the only thing I even get up for is to care for my animals. I called her because I couldn't take it anymore, I couldn't sleep properly, either ate nothing or binged myself, didn't care for myself, had panic attacks when I even left my room. 

I tried before lock down to go to the doctors and my appointment got cancelled and moved to a phone appointment, I have a huge fear anxiety around phones and couldn't do it so I've just got worse and worse waiting for face to face appointments to come back but they never did. 

I tried 6months before lockdown but they just dismissed it as my depression cycle and gave me pills that I told them didn't work, and never bothered to follow up.

My sister called and set up a phone appointment then answered it and did most of the talking for me while I tried to control my panic attack, I did speak a bit and the doctor I got was lovely made me feel believed and that my problem was real, she's put me on new meds for both anxiety and depression and helped me self refer to therapy coz apparently doctors in the uk arnt allowed to refer people to therapy anymore incase there forcing them to go when they don't want to. Anyway it's a long wait list and may be a phone appointment (why always with the bloody phones 😪) but my sister agreed to help me get through it.  

I don't feel any better but I have a plan now, so I suppose that's something. I might try have a shower tomorrow it's been a couple of weeks, maybe it'll make me feel......something. 

Any way I just wanted to share to say, even if you think no one cares just keep trying, not like theres much left to loose, and you might just find one person who can help."

Some people see that ond ugly photo and say,now is the time to lose weight.

I never had that. I am not able to just start and do it. Dieting works 2 days at the most.
Getting up early and get studying does not even work in the first place. Even an accountability partner only helps sometimes.
The only thing that gets me out of bed is paid work, where I could get fired if I were not to be there.
So I stay in bed 26 hours a day and waste my life away, waiting for that cruel wonder to happen to me where I realize that I am worth something.

depression,"Why ? I have everything to be happy, but for some reason I always find a way to feel like crap and am in desperate need for self confidence. For instance not later than today I showed my crush my darkest side, just to make sure I won't have a chance so I don't regret not telling her. Also sometimes I randomly start hating myself, and most of the time I think about myself I have a random nausea. I hate myself so I avoid sleep (had like 5h in 2 days), and take a boiling shower and then switch to freezing cold just to hurt myself (only non-definitive things cuz I don't want to regret it) I also drink (I'm 15) have a porn/masturbation addiction. I consider myself as a bad person and even if my crush asked me out I d tell her no to not disappoint her, and start acting like a dick so if she thought she loved me, she would no longer do. I have an obsession with grades and feel like i will never be enough (in general). Every day it's getting worst. (I did my best to explain how I feel lmao)

I am not English so if I made any mistake, don't be scared to roast me lol

Also this probably has nothing to do with depression but I felt like this community would understand me...

Wish you the best and cya xoxo"
depression,"Quick question about mental hospitals Do the mental hospitals choose your roommate? Or is it random?
I was admitted last month. Just curious. "
depression,"Thanks you all. I've discovered this sub today, probably because I didn't want to before. I'm 23, yeah it's still young. But for the past year I'm no longer myself. I used to be alive, doing stuff and things all day. 
Now I can barely hold a day without having a mental break. I used to paint and play, but I can't even focus on it for more than few minuts. 
My depression cost my girl, my friends, my family. Because none of them understand. Because they couldn't stand the frighten, broken man I turned into. I cannot sleep very well, I just wait to pass out from exhaustion. 
Every time I watch myself in the mirror I just see a broken version of me, who gain weight, except on the face, with eyes who lost their will. 
I didn't feel human contact for a year, not a hug, not a kind word or normal conversation. But still I am here, telling all this to a bunch of strangers who have a similar issue.
It's the first time I manage to write this, but it doesn't really help. 

What does is to know that you are all here, with sometimes similar issues. That all of you know what it's like. And seeing others sharing... It helps. It helps knowing I'm not mading all up like the rest use to tell me. 

So thanks you. From what's left of me and my heart, thanks you all for being here. For sharing. For speaking to each other. 
To live with it, and yet, managing to find the time to help others. 
Thanks you."

Ever since I was a kid I’ve always had this problem and I thought it was normal but I was always afraid to ask people, as I’m getting a little older I’m getting a lot weirder thoughts like incest racism homosexuality family members dying me dying some sick disgusting things 

Sometimes I’ll have random thoughts of having sex with random women I see and not because I like them or anything just because of these thoughts 

I searched it up on google and it was just some it’s normal to be gay on some weird shit but I’m not gay I don’t fw that 

I really don’t want to have these thoughts but they just pop up in my head and the more I try to stop thinking about it the worse it gets

Should I talk to my doctor in private about this do I need help or medication

mentalhealth,"[25M] I'm not sure why I feel this way.. I recently stopped smoking weed (after doing it almost every day for 6 years) because it was taking a toll on my mental health, making me paranoid, etc. and it would help me feel comfortable being alone. I would almost never want to do anything social after smoking.

However...it's been about 3 weeks and I feel super lonely. It's made me realize that I have very few friends and for some reason I feel like I NEED a significant other. I know this is wrong and unhealthy, but lately I have no motivation to do much besides get the little work I need to done for the day and scour dating apps trying to force something.

I know that I need to be comfortable being with myself and not needing drugs or alcohol to feel ""fine."" Any advice would be really appreciated because I feel stuck and like I'm regressing."

my moods rapidly change from good times with my mates to down right suicidal as soon as they leave me

I constantly belittle people and make them upset, and get enjoyment out of it, however much i find myself trying to stop that kind of behaviour i end up doing it anyway

I get a lot of built up frustration from just being around people I like or dislike, and I very often get to the point where i'm just bursting with anger and sadness at like 11 o'clock at night and having nightly breakdowns of the same thing every time

fully aware this could just be a classic case of teenager syndrome but i'm interested to see if anybody knows more about these things than I do, because i'm mostly oblivious"
mentalhealth,"I dont know where to start So,

 i've been aware of my mental issues for years now, i've actually go to a psychologist before, twice actually (i've always think that mental health should be treated just like regular health) 
But both those times i got sent to the psychologist by my parents, not really remeber their reasons, it was years ago.

Now i want to go on my own, i'm a 20 y/o male from Chile, i can go to therapy pretty much for free in my college.

The thing is, i dont know what to say once i'm there,because i think i have plenty of issues, not too heavy i guess because i can still notice them in my own mind, said issues are low self esteem, anxiety, depression, anger issues and a toxic relationship with my mom.  Again, these issues arent as bad as for other folks, mad respect for them that endure worse. 

I think i can trace most of my things from the low self esteem and anger issues, those can be the main deal here, so i think i could start there.


Anyone else that went/its going through something similar?


PD; sorry if its poorly worded or something, as i said, i'm from Chile and i've never been to an english speaking country lol"

So my boyfriend and I have been good friends for about 6 years before we started our relationship 7 months ago. He knows I’ve struggled before with anxiety and that I’m going to a doctor for it. I started a new medication at my doctors request, see if it works and all. And honestly it’s making everything worse??

BF commented on my anxiety earlier in the day, saying he thinks it’s getting worse, and that I seem to be falling apart a lot faster/easier. Well, tonight around 8pm I started slipping into a really bad depressive state and it feels so bad. He’s never seen me in one, over that past couple years I hid mine as best I could from my friends, with probably isn’t good. He’s been comforting me best he can, and I feel more human, but I feel such static and lumpy grey and I keep weeping all the time. 

BF has told me before that he gets upset when I get upset, like a sympathetic reaction. So when I’m laying next to him weeping, I feel even worse because I’m upsetting him, even though he says he’s fine. 

Ugh I don’t know, I feel so ugly rn"
mentalhealth,"Help with depression. Throwaway because my friends know my actual account. 

Basically, I’m depressed. I know I am. I’m not some twelve year old whose sad because they can’t find a date for the dance. I have seriously wondered if my life means anything to anyone.

I want to live, but sometimes I don’t know that I deserve it. I would never do anything to intentionally harm myself or others, I just wonder if I should give up. Resign myself to nothingness.

I want to speak with a therapist, and have asked my parents to set up sessions on multiple occasions. They haven’t yet. They don’t know that I’m depressed. I suppose telling them might help them understand I need to talk to someone, but everytime I think about telling them I’m crippled by fear. I don’t know how they’ll react, if they’re going to laugh and think I’m just trying to get attention, or if they even believe in mental illness. I don’t know what to do.

I attend an online school due to health problems, I rarely talk to others outside my immediate family, and most days I do nothing. I’m left alone with my thoughts and nothing but time. I struggle everyday trying unsuccessfully to lose weight, my teeth are in terrible condition, and I can see all my friends surpassing me as I was held back.

What do I do? I want so bad to get help, but I’m so afraid of what will happen when I do. I don’t want my family knowing what’s wrong, but I have no other way of conveying the seriousness of my situation. What am I supposed to do?"
mentalhealth,"what happens if you go inpatient but treatment fails and you continue to say you rather end you life once you are let out? 

If you don't respond to intensive treatment at a mental hospital after going voluntarily or not, Do you get out in a permanent psyche ward indefinitely? People keeps saying you spend a week or 2. What if you are way far gone and each time you're asked if you're safe to leave, you keep saying no? Do they just kick you out after a while due ti lack of funds/insurance or do you keep getting locked up and go to a state institute? If you don't just lie and say you're fine and keep saying, no treatment isn't helping and I will end my life when I leave this hospital. What happens then?"
mentalhealth,I just miss my dad When I was around five or six my dad moved away from us. My mom kicked him out after a while after she learned about him getting back into drug's. I haven't talked to him in a while around a year not for a by reason I just haven't. He lives in Hawaii and I live in Washington. so shit he could have got corona and I wouldn't know. He comes in conversation a lot in my family almost as like just a joke.My entire family especially the younger people tend to joke about our problems and eachothers.The same fucking thing happens to my cousin. Her dad relapsed and her mom kicked him out boom she barely even knows her dad. 80percent of my problems would be fixed had he been able to stay. The majority of the time I say his name it's as a fucking punchline. He has a very distinct smell very distinct like black guy smell(and no it's not weed he did sometimes eat lot brownies) I don't know how to describe besides funky. But I was laying down and suddenly smelt that same smell on me and it triggered this whole rant I'm just sad and miss him.
mentalhealth,Anxiety because of work So last Thursday I was screamed at by two of my managers because I sat down in lobby for a minute to fix the back of my shoe and sent home early. I was told I was not allowed to return to work until I talked to the general manager of the store. I’m going in tomorrow but I can’t sleep and I feel like I’m the verge of an anxiety attack. I’m terrified I’m going to lose my job because of this even though it’s my first incident since I started working there almost a year ago where I was sent home and told the same thing because of an actual incident that happened. I can’t afford to lose this job either due to bills and etc. 
mentalhealth,"So I have a problem. I mean this is kinda a way to vent but I’m also wondering if I can get a different perspective on this too. So my parents always correct me on everything, everything I do needs to be corrected to them. Even the things I do I seem to get corrected on. And my dad talks to me like he’s disappointed and disgusted with what I’ve done. But here’s the thing, everyone does the same thing they keep telling me not to do. So for instance, rinse your food out of the dishes before putting them in the sink. So yes I agree with this rule. But no one else is told to do that and everyone else gets away with it. But I’m always told to do it and talked to about it. Then I bring up to the person talking that literally everyone in the house doesn’t do this so why am I supposed to listen if no one else does? So then the person I’m talking to complains and complains and says “we’re not talking about them right now because I’m talking to you” I know there saying that to shift the conversation away and put the blame on me like I control all the food on all the dishes and like it’s always my fault. But this happens with literally everything and I always get talked down to and blamed for it and no one else changes there habits but they expect me to change mine."

New here.

I have a depression and I am autistic (aspergers), and I have recently decided to share my journey with other people. About how I deal with things (or not) and how I am going to deal with things, how I am (going to be) fighting my depression, and maybe in the process of this all, hopefully be able to not just help myself by talking about these things, but also help other people with simillar issues, or even just give them the courage to talk to someone or get help.

My first video of the year I am just explaining some things about me, where I have been and where I want to go.

But I will be creating more video's (not just about these two subjects) about depression and autism.

Hope you guys and girls appreciate what I am trying to do here, and maybe take the time to watch my video and give me some things to talk about, like, what you want ""regular""/healthy people to know and be made aware of, or just say hi to me and to support me on this.

mentalhealth,"Advice for dealing with self harm urges ? I have heard of the rubber band thing where you smack yourself with a rubber band and it’s supposed to help with self harm urges, but I get very itchy and scratch through skin when feeling overwhelmed and those are the urges that I can’t seem to get a grip on.

I know for a fact when I see things, and I know if and when my memory is a bit fuzzy. 

My friends especially mock me and say, “of course you’re always right and we’re wrong” and “he just keeps going, he always thinks he’s right” and it’s really pissing me off. They act as if I can never except the truth and that I must always have it my way , despite the fact that I am sometimes wrong (like all human beings) and admit for my mistake and apologize. 

However, when I make a valid point/argument that does not agree with theirs, they say I’m stupid and must be seeing things! I can even present them with proof and they’ll immediately brush it off or say some other bullshit. I have not and cannot win literally any argument or debate and I’m sick and tired of it. I wish I would’ve never been honest with these people. 

I try my absolute hardest to be truthful and open about myself so that they will do the same in return, but I assume they are too afraid or insecure of themselves to be honest to me. I’m honestly shocked that I’m still so genuine, even when it backfires every single time.

[TL;DR] my friends weaponize my diagnosis and openness against me to make themselves feel superior :-/"
schizophrenia,"What place did/does music have in your delusions and experiences When I had the “prophet phase”  when I thought I was jesus, what I thought was the original Jesus told me to look into art and music for the The truth.  Climbing up the walls by Radiohead was a thing at first, After that, I had a soundtrack to everything. What about yous? Did any bands or songs feel like part of it? Or the role of music overall?"
schizophrenia,"(Repost because the original post was removed for spam) I had an introductory meeting for a PHP a few days ago. The doctor referred to my ""voices"" as alters. Do I belong here? The more I try to understand my condition, the farther away the answer seems.

I've always felt different among schizophrenics. The diagnosis seems too...restrictive and dismissive of my experiences.

I don't *just* hear voices. I would describe them as a complex network of hallucinations that create the experience of having multiple personalities in my head (that, or I actually *do* have multiple personalities). I was intrigued that my PHP doctor would choose the word ""alters"" to describe my situation.

And this isn't just this one person - multiple people, both on and off this subreddit, have asked me if I have DID when I explain what I experience.

Thoughts?"
schizophrenia,"SEVERE Schizoaffective Negative Symptoms I just turned 25 and at the age of 18 my life drastically hit the gutter. I was diagnosed with Bipolar 1 and Schizophrenia. My manic (positive symptoms) episodes last several months and they get bad...I mean BAD. Extremely bizarre delusions about everything, total personality change, restlessness, agitation, paranoia, confrontational, excessive talking, risky sexual encounters/drug use. Then it turns into a mixed episode...then...an EXTREME low functioning depression that lasts until I become manic (what a way to live....). During my depression episodes, my negative symptoms are so bad that I literally sit in a chair all day until I go to sleep. I don't have to energy or drive to do anything and even if I try to do something out of the house, my anhedonia is so terrible there's no point. My cognitive functions/motor skills are very weak. Dramatic flattened affect. Every simple task is exhausting. I have debilitating alogia where I can't think of anything to say other than single words. My mind just feels like this black hole. I feel sooooo guilty because I can't interact with my family like I used to before 18 years old. I was a completely different person. I just feel nothing. Like I'm this empty catonic shell of zero personality. A true zombie. I don't feel anything but numbness besides depression/anxiety/guilt. Makes me feel so damn f☆☆king guilty. The guilt is overwhelming because I want to engage in conversation with my family but I literally CAN'T. And every time I can come up with a word or short sentence, my voice is severely monotonous. I'm sorry I'm complaining so much, but this illness has 100% taken over my life and soul. Does anyone else experience negative symptoms this severe or am I the only one? I'm so catonic it doesn't seem possible for any other human to be this bad. I don't consider myself human anymore."
schizophrenia,Thinking your saying your thoughts out loud/ people hearing your thoughts. If you feel like people can hear your thoughts how do you cope? I find it really hard to be around friends/family.

schizophrenia,"Have your symptoms made you seek religion or changed your religion? For a little while, I tried praying to both god and satan.  Then things got a little scary since I was hearing satans voice and so I decided to pray to only god.  I ended up reading the Bible every day.  I used to be atheist.  But things got scary."

schizophrenia,"Tuning in Does anyone ever have a tuning in moment for those that hear voices?  Like the voices are mostly garbled or whispers until I actually pay attention.  I dissociate a lot though, so maybe that's why?"

schizophrenia,"My life is hell Hi I’m new here and I haven’t been fully diagnosed yet. I’m at risk for developing schizophrenia but right now my diagnosis is major depressive disorder with serve psychosis. I wake up every morning to spiders crawling on my ceiling. I hear voice that yell at me and tell me to hurt myself. The new medicine helps but yet this is still happening. I’m beyond paranoid and think somethings out to get me. 

Now I have a new hallucination. It’s a bald man with a black suit and white button up shirt. He wears black sunglasses and follows me around. I see him at work just staring at me. Then in a blink of an eye, he’s gone. He also tells me they are coming. I don’t know who they are but I feel a sense of dread every time he speaks. I try to ignore him but he can talk to me telepathically. Most of the time I don’t even see him but just here him. He keeps saying they are coming.  I have an appointment with my psychiatrist this week and hope to get answers."
schizophrenia,"Is it possible to have an stable relationship? Hi, i’m new to this reddit and i just need help and thought i would come here and write about it.

Sorry for my english i’m not a native speaker and i’m just trying my best."
schizophrenia,"Thoughts on using meditation to manifest hallucinations? Do you think you could use meditation to manifest positive hallucinations? Just a random idea that came to my head since I know not all hallucinations are negative/bad. 

A year or two ago I tried to force hallucinations when looking at art (just for a small trip) but that was before I started meditating.

 Or, do you think this is a bad idea because it blurs the line between reality and hallucination"
schizophrenia,Anyone else feel no emotion I canr cry im never truly happy i just want to get drunk to feel but have no friends to deink with i hate my life so much
schizophrenia,"Demonic possession? My mom has always been a very strict religious woman. I converted to Christianity in secret. She is of other faith

At the age of 22 I developed really bad psychosis. I will try to sum it up in points so this thread is as short as possible. Now im 24.

* visual hallucinations (seeing shadow figures, small animals, objects moving, a distorted face in my mirror) etc.
* auditory hallucinations (hearing a baby cry or someone call my name when no one is home). 
* touch sensations when no one is around (feelings of movement in body similar to a snake- someone touching my thighs or um.. down there, movements of inner organs). 
* dissociation when im anxious or sad.. etc.

My mom tried to exorcise me. I went downstairs to have dinner and she invited a religious figure to eat with us and then she asked me to stay and chat with him. He ended up trying to exorcise me.

He gave me some medicine that gave me diarrhea and made me vomit to purge the body of evil.

I got sick for a few days. Mum kept adding holy water to the water bottle i drink from and blasting religious verses on the radio outside my bedroom. Sprinkling sea salt and burning sage. Being crazy...

Saved up money and went to a doctor of psychiatry. Told me I have schizophrenia. She didnt allow me to take medicines but I'm taking them in secret. 

I know I'm sick in the head but she is scaring me.

schizophrenia,"PBA and Schizophrenia I’m lightly schizophrenic, however for the longest time I’ve had issues with laughing, and sometimes crying, for absolutely no reason. I have a very low EQ, so it’s not emotional, but for some reason I just laugh or cry for no reason. I’ve lightly read that it is related to schizophrenia, but I’m just wondering if anyone else experiences this. Very confusing."
